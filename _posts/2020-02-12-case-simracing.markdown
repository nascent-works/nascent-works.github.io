We are developing an esports platform for sim racing community. The platform will simplify thehosting of racing leagues and tournaments, feature automatic race result collection and racer performance data tracking. The platform will include experimental in-game economy to foster relations between sponsors, teams, players and modding community. The project is developed in partnership with RaceDepartment- the largest sim racing community in the world.
