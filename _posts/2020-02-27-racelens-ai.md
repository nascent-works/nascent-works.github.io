# In a nutshell
More than 4000 running races are held annually all around the world with millions of participants. RaceLens platform identifies bib numbers of contestants and utilizes AI algorithms to sort uploaded event pictures without any manual tagging - enabling participants to discover the shots where they are pictured.

# The challenge
The participant numbers for largest running events can easily exceed tens of thousands. Pictures of runners are taken all along the competition track by multiple photographers. After each event the organizers are left with a vast collection of race pictures with no easy way to arrange, categorize and publish them online for easy discovery.

# The platform
Racelens AI provides an automated platform for race event picture categorization and publishing. It works in 3 easy steps:
* Running event pictures are uploaded onto Racelens self-service platform.
* Racelens AI identifies bib numbers worn by contestants. No manual tagging or custom bib format is required. The platform works with standard bib layouts that most events currently use.
* The sorted picture gallery is published online. Race participants can discover pictures where they are featured simply by entering their bib number into the search box. The pictures can be shared to social media websites.

The platform provides multiple benefits for competition organizers:
* Improving participant experience. Runners can relive their ‘runners high’ by discovering the moments from the race after the event. 
* Improving event visibility. Social media enables the pictures to be discovered by a wider network of people.
* Create new sponsorship opportunities. Every race picture can feature a branded overlay. It creates a unique digital sponsorship opportunity for event sponsors. This sponsorship position can widen the audience reach for title event sponsors or provide a relevant opportunity for endemic ones (sports attire, cameras, bottled water etc.)
